📖 Introduction

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a hierarchical data structure in which each node contains a key and a maximum of two children. The BST follows an ordering rule:
	•	Keys in the left subtree are smaller than the parent node.
	•	Keys in the right subtree are greater than the parent node.

BSTs are widely used for fast searching, insertion, and deletion operations due to their sorted structural property.



🎯 Objective of the Project

The main objective of this project is to:
	•	Implement a Binary Search Tree in C++
	•	Demonstrate major BST operations:
✔ Insertion
✔ Searching
✔ Deletion
✔ Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
	•	Analyze the time complexity of each operation.

.  ✔ Features / Operations Implemented

Insertion
Adds a new node while maintaining BST property.

Search
Finds whether a given key exists in the BST.

Deletion
Handles all three cases:

Node with no child

Node with one child

Node with two children

Tree Traversals

Inorder → Left, Root, Right (Sorted output)

Preorder → Root, Left, Right

Postorder → Left, Right, Root

Menu-driven interface
User can choose operations interactively



🧠 Key Features
	•	Dynamic memory allocation using nodes and pointers
	•	No duplicate values allowed
	•	Console-based menu-driven program
	•	Supports multiple operations in one execution
